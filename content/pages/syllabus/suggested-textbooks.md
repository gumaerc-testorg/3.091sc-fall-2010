{{% resource_link "1cc82bd7-8ea3-2301-16a6-db5c2b67e84a" "Periodic Table of the Elements (PDF)" %}}

{{% resource_link "13fd6b1d-7f4c-27e1-aa1b-f83b92d2d6b6" "Fundamental Physical Constants (PDF)" %}}

This list of constants is the "Frequently Used Constants" collection from the U.S. National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST) website {{% resource_link "1a6870bd-2224-4a30-8734-c4078b53212d" "Fundamental Physical Constants" %}}. This resource contains additional constants in many categories if you're looking for something not contained in the above PDF.

## Suggested Textbooks

To search for these books in libraries near you, consult this WorldCat list of {{% resource_link "ea8dbada-4404-40cd-8c87-5c9e871ef8de" "3.091 OCW Scholar Textbooks" %}}.

If you are unable to obtain some of these books, Professor Sadoway suggests using any good college-level introductions to general chemistry, materials science, organic chemistry, and biochemistry instead. In each session's reading assignment, summaries of the topics covered should help you find the relevant sections in alternate texts.

### Key

The bracketed abbreviations preceding each citation are used throughout this site to refer to each textbook.

### Primary Text on General Chemistry
